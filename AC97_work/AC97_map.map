Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    58 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          183
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            66 out of     183   36%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  55 out of     183   30%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          62 out of     183   33%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               7 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        56 out of     640    8%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       55 out of      56   98%
