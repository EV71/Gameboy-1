Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     3 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                   3
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         24 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       24 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              24

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    16 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           27
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            24 out of      27   88%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   3 out of      27   11%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of      27    0%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               1 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        33 out of     640    5%
