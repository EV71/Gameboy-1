WARNING:Timing:3223 - Timing constraint TS_dvi_setup = MAXDELAY FROM TIMEGRP 
   "dvi_c" TO TIMEGRP "dvi_d" 0.5 ns; ignored during timing analysis.
WARNING:Timing:3223 - Timing constraint TS_dvi_hold = MAXDELAY FROM TIMEGRP 
   "dvi_d" TO TIMEGRP "dvi_c" 0.5 ns; ignored during timing analysis.
INFO:Timing:3412 - To improve timing, see the Timing Closure User Guide (UG612).
INFO:Timing:2752 - To get complete path coverage, use the unconstrained paths 
   option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in the 
   unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.
INFO:Timing:3339 - The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on 
   a 50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, 
   and for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, 
   please see the device datasheet.
