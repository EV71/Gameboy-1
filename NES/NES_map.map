Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    76 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  76
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         92 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       91 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              73
      Number using O5 output only:              16
      Number using O5 and O6:                    2
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        17
    Number using O6 output only:                17

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    40 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          111
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            35 out of     111   31%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  19 out of     111   17%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          57 out of     111   51%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               8 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        12 out of     640    1%

    IOB Flip Flops:                              5

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      3 out of      32    9%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        3
