  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           80
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            24 out of      80   30%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  16 out of      80   20%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          40 out of      80   50%
    Number of unique control sets:               5
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               8 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
