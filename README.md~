==========================
This is our 18-545 project, a mostly working original Game Boy on an FPGA.
If you have cloned this repo you probably want to know something about how it works, so we will explain that.
==========================

==========
Structure
==========
There are two top-level ISE projects. GAMEBOY_TOP works with the actual 
cartridge, and GAMEBOY_TOP_SIMPLE works with a "flashcart" which is a ROM with
the bootstrap code appended to the front of it.

The actual top-level verilog module is lcd_top.v which is located in 
cpu/cpusynth for GAMEBOY_TOP, and in GAMEBOY_TOP_SIMPLE for that project. 
This is called lcd_top because we were using the code given in Lab 1 to 
control the LCD screen and never got around to changing the name. And it 
would break everything if we did it now.

lcd_top instantiates all the modules that make up the Game Boy, including
the CPU, the GPU, the DVI module, the audio interface, the cartridge interface,
the NES controller, the rotary controller, timers, DMA, clock dividers,
and the link cable.

The code for the cpu is located in the cpu folder. Everything relating to the
CPU is located here except the header file cpu.vh which had to be in the top-
level directory. The auto_testbench is also included here, along with the 
bootstrap flash files and a Perl script to convert hex files.

The code for the GPU is located in the fpgaboy_files folder. Everything
relating to the GPU including the DVI module is located here, except for the
block RAM IP cores, which are located in the GPU_IP/ipcore_dir folder.

The code for the audio interface is located in the sound_src folder. Everything
relating to sound production including the setup of the AC97 codec is located
here, except for the rotary controller which is a top level file.

All other modules are located at the top level. These include the rotary
controller, the NES controller, the cartridge interface, the clock divider,
and the link cable.
