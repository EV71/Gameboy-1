WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   gb80_cpu/gb80_alu/alu_data_out_7_not0001 is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.

    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,555 out of   2,215   70%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 197 out of   2,215    8%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         463 out of   2,215   20%

      to control set restrictions:             132 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
