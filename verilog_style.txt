SystemVerilog to Verilog notes
================================================================================
1. Module instantiations are different. They follow the format

   module ModuleName(input0, input1, ... inputM, output0, output1, ... outputN);
      output [widthN-1:0] outputN
      ...
      input [widthM-1:0] inputM
      ...
   
      // Code here

      // Note the lack of a semicolon below
   endmodule

2. Variable types are different. No longer is everything a wire. Combinational
   variables are "wire"s, but state variables are now "reg"s.

3. There are no more always_comb blocks, only always. For always_comb, specify
   always @(*) begin
      // Code
   end
   and for state variables (registers, state machines, etc.) specify
   always @(posedge clock or posedge reset) begin
      // Code
   end

================================================================================
Emacs Verilog Mode
================================================================================
Use emacs' verilog-mode. Install verilog-mode from
http://www.veripool.org/projects/verilog-mode/wiki/Installing

and put this in your ~/.emacs file:

;; Load verilog-mode automatically and name it
(autoload 'verilog-mode "verilog-mode" "Verilog mode" t)
;; Add .vh files to the list of files Verilog mode updates (not on by default)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.[ds]?vh?\\'" . verilog-mode))
;; Verilog adds newlines by default when you write a semi-colon. This is stupid.
;; Turn that off.
(add-hook 'verilog-mode-hook
	  '(lambda ()
	     (setq verilog-auto-newline nil)
	     ))

Using verilog-mode:
There are really two features of verilog-mode that I use, you may want to use
more. These are AUTOINST and AUTOARG.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOINST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This feature automatically wires up a new module's input and output wires to
wires in the instantiating module that are named the same. To use this,
instantiate your module like so:

module InstanceName #(params) (/*AUTOINST*/);

When you invoke verilog-mode's auto feature, it will add all the wires below the
/*AUTOINST*/ like so:

module InstanceName #(params) (/*AUTOINST*/
       		    	      // Outputs
			      .output0		(output0[31:0]),
		              .output1		(output1[0]),
		              .outputN	        (outputN[Nwidth-1:0]),
			      // Inputs
		              .input0		(input0[31:0]),
		              .inputM		(inputM[Mwidth-1:0]));

Note that all the wires must have exactly the same name in the instantiated
module and the top module for this to work. This also helpfully makes it obvious
when the wires are different sizes by explicitly specifying the width. If they
mismatch, the compiler should warn you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOARG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This works like AUTOINST, but for the arguments in a module declaration. To use
this, when you are declaring a new module, declare it like this:

module ModuleName(/*AUTOARG*/);
   output [31:0] output0;
   output [3:0] output1;
   output [Nwidth-1:0] outputN;
   input [31:0] input0;
   input [3:0] input1;
   input [Mwidth-1:0] outputM;

After activating verilog-mode's auto feature, the arguments will automatically
be added to the declaration like so:

module ModuleName(/*AUTOARG*/
   // Outputs
   inst_addr, mem_addr, mem_data_in, mem_write_en, halted,
   // Inputs
   clk, inst_excpt, mem_excpt, inst, mem_data_out, rst_b
   );
   
   output [31:0] output0;
   ...

There are other features, which can be found at the verilog-mode home site,
http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilog-mode

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Invoking Verilog Mode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In emacs, type
M-x verilog-auto

From the command line, for non-emacs users, type
emacs --batch <filenames.v> -f verilog-batch-auto

================================================================================
Verilog Style
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely Required Rules (if you disregard these, you will have A Bad Time)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ALWAYS WRITE COMMENTS.

2. All outputs and inputs to modules must be specified in the following order:
   1. Outputs from largest width to smallest width
   2. Inputs from largest width to smallest width

3. All outputs must by of type "wire" (unless there's some pressing need to do
   otherwise) and all inputs must be of unspecified type.

4. All variable names must be consistent across large modules. This does not
   apply to things that are instantiated many times, like registers. The naming
   convention is to prepend the name of the module (or some abbreviation, if the
   name is too long) to the signal names. For example, the halt signal on the
   cpu module should be called "cpu_halt."

   The exception to the prepend rule is for things such as clocks and resets,
   which are much better left being just called clock. This is covered below.

   This is stupid and annoying, but it must be followed because verilog mode can
   only wire up wires that are of the same name.

5. The clock is named "clock" and is posedge. Across clock domains, it can be
   renamed with a prefix.

6. The reset is named "reset" and is posedge. If there must be more than one
   reset, it can be renamed with a prefix after you have asked yourself why you
   need more than one reset.

7. Never continuously assign to a reg variable (i.e. reg a = 5). The only
   exception is in a testbench, where for some reason "always #5 clock = ~clock"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Style Rules (if you disregard these, everyone will be unhappy, including you, 
but you won't die in a fire)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ALWAYS WRITE COMMENTS IN GOOD STYLE.
   I was using the Javadoc style of
   /**
    * Short description.
    *
    * Long description.
    * 
    * @inout name Description.
    * @output name Description.
    * @input name Description.
    */

2. Variable names in lowercaseword0_lowercaseword1_..._lowercasewordn format.
   An example of this is "cpu_halt." Name files and modules accordingly.

3. Use as few inputs and outputs as possible. Go crazy inside your module, but
   in standard Verilog there's a penalty for having more variables, and that is
   your sanity.

4. Convert indents to spaces. Hard tabs are the spawn of the devil. In emacs the
   .emacs setting for this is
   (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

5. Use a sane indent format (that is, emacs' verilog-mode format). This can be
   achieved for emacs users by selecting all and hitting tab (C-x h; TAB). For
   non-emacs users, you can run basically this command on the file in batch mode
   with 
   emacs --batch <filenames> -f verilog-batch-indent
   (I think)

6. Always use begin and end after anything that allows it. Don't do things like
   if (reset)
      var0 <= 0;
   because eventually someone will inadvertently add a line below var0 <= 0;
   and forget that there is no begin and end.

================================================================================
A Note About Testbenches
================================================================================

The 341 style should be used for simple testbenches. That is, write the
following at the top of your testbench:

initial clock = 0;
always #5 clock = ~clock;

and in the main initial block do things like
initial begin
   repeat (5) begin
      // Change some inputs
      @(posedge clock);
   end
end

And either monitor your results or display them every so often.

More complicated things can be done later on, like reading assembly files from
disk. There was a framework in 447 to do this that I will probably convert.
